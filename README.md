# utility-scripts

This repo contains a collection of niche standalone utility python scripts and also some code that can be used as imports.

All standalone scripts can be found in the `scripts` directory. Each script has an outlined problem as the first comment, followed by constants that work as settings. 

Scripts that are designed to be used as imports can be found in the `imports` directory.

### Standalone scripts:
